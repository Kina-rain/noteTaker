# Note Taker
This project was to make a program that will allow a user to take notes. 

## Description

This application allows a user to create, list, save and delete notes that are stored in a JSON file locally.

This application will help users to keep track of their thoughts and after completing their to do list will be able to delete their tasks.

## Business Context

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget important information. Thus, being able to take and delete

notes continuously will allow users to have written information available when needed.
